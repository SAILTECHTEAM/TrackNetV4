# TrackNet V4 PyTorch

A PyTorch implementation of **TrackNet V4: Enhancing Fast Sports Object Tracking with Motion Attention Maps** for real-time tracking of small, fast-moving objects in sports videos.

## Overview

TrackNet V4 enhances sports object tracking by incorporating motion attention maps that focus on temporal changes between consecutive frames. The model excels at tracking small, fast-moving objects like tennis balls and ping-pong balls in challenging scenarios with occlusion and motion blur.

**Key Features:**
- Motion-aware tracking with attention mechanisms
- Real-time video processing capabilities  
- Robust handling of occlusion and motion blur
- End-to-end training pipeline

## Requirements

- Python ≥ 3.10
- PyTorch ≥ 1.9.0
- CUDA (recommended for training)

## Pretrained Model

A pretrained model checkpoint is available for download:

This model was trained on the dataset and achieves strong performance metrics on the test set (see Performance section below).

The pretrained model achieves the following metrics on the test dataset:

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 94.4% |
| Precision | 95.8% |
| Recall | 97.2% |
| F1-Score | 96.5% |

*Evaluation performed on center frame predictions with threshold 0.5 and tolerance 4px*



## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnInsomniacy/tracknet-v4-pytorch.git

```

## Model Architecture

TrackNet V4 introduces motion attention to enhance tracking performance:

- **Input:** 3 consecutive RGB frames (9 channels, 288×512)
- **Motion Prompt Layer:** Extracts motion attention from frame differences  
- **Encoder-Decoder:** VGG-style architecture with skip connections
- **Output:** Object probability heatmaps (3 channels, 288×512)

The motion attention mechanism focuses on regions with significant temporal changes, improving detection of fast-moving objects.

## Data Format

**Input Structure:**
```
dataset/
├── inputs/          # RGB frames (288×512)
└── heatmaps/        # Ground truth heatmaps (288×512)
```

- Input: 3 consecutive frames concatenated into 9-channel tensors
- Heatmaps: Gaussian distributions centered on object locations
